2
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,257
Where are you? Come out!

3
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,426
Come out!

4
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,262
Come on out.

5
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,347
I'm coming to get you.

6
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,639
Where are you, you little rascal?
I'm coming to get you.

7
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,690
Hm.

8
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,484
Where is my little birthday girl, hm?

9
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,606
I'm going to gobble her up
when I find her.

10
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,487
Om

11
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,534
I'm going to eat you. Lam.

12
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,123
Och, Fergus, no weapons on the table.

13
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,417
Can I shoot an arrow?
Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I?

14
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,711
Please? Can I?

15
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,790
Not with that. Why not...

16
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,216
...use your very own?

17
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,591
Happy birthday, my Wee darling!

18
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,513
Now, there's a good girl.

19
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,186
Draw all the way back now
to your cheek. That's right.

20
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,473
Keep both eyes open.

21
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,434
And, loose!

22
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,563
- I missed.
- Go and fetch it, then.

23
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,869
A bow, Fergus? She's a lady.

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,987
Ooh! You!

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,447
A will-0'- the-wisp.

26
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,870
They are real.

27
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,430
Merida, come along, sweetheart.

28
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,678
- We're leaving now.
- I saw a wisp.

29
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,770
- I saw a wisp.
- A wisp?

30
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:45,193
You know, some say that
will-o'- the-wisps lead you to your fate.

31
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,736
- Oh, aye. Or an arrow.
- Och!

32
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,815
Come on, let's be off before we see
a dancing Tatty Bogle.

33
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,320
Or a giant having a jigger
in the bluebells.

34
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,277
Your father doesn't believe in magic.

35
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,783
Well, he should. Because it's true.

36
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,542
Mor'du! Elinor, run!

37
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,585
Sire!

38
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,345
Come on, you!

39
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,980
<i>Some say our destiny
is tied to the land...</i>

40
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,525
<i>...as much a part of us as we are of it.</i>

41
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,707
<i>Others say fate is woven together
like a cloth.</i>

42
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,545
<i>So that one's destiny intertwines
with many others.</i>

43
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:55,550
<i>It's the one thing we search for
or fight to change.</i>

44
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,341
<i>Some never find it.</i>

45
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,722
<i>But there are some who are led.</i>

46
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,479
<i>The story of how my father lost his leg</i>

47
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,860
<i>to the demon bear Mor'du
became legend.</i>

48
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,821
<i>I became a sister to three new brothers.</i>

49
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,908
<i>The princes.
Hamish, Hubert and Harris.</i>

50
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,918
<i>Wee devils, more like.</i>

51
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,496
<i>They get away with murder.</i>

52
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,832
<i>I can never get away with anything.</i>

53
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,840
<i>I'm the princess.</i>

54
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,512
Oh!

55
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,589
<i>I'm the example.</i>

56
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,603
<i>I've got duties, responsibilities,
expectations.</i>

57
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,476
<i>My whole life is planned out,</i>

58
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,523
<i>preparing for the day I become...</i>

59
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,020
<i>Well, my mother.</i>

60
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,944
<i>She's in charge
of every single day of my life.</i>

61
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,868
"Aye, Robin, Jolly Robin,
and thou shalt know of mine."

62
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,069
Project!

63
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,071
"And thou shalt know of mine!"

64
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,700
Enunciate. You must be understood
from anywhere in the room,

65
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,376
or it's all for naught.

66
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,954
- This is all for naught.
- I heard that!

67
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,539
From the top.

68
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,592
A princess must be knowledgeable
about her kingdom.

69
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,129
She does not doodle.

70
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,758
That's a C, dear.

71
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,567
A princess does not chortle.

72
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,690
- Mm!
- Does not stuff her gob!

73
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,487
Rises early.

74
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,361
...Is compassionate...

75
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,862
...patient, cautious,

76
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:40,908
clean.

77
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:47,993
And above all, a princess
strives for... Well, perfection.

78
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,165
<i>But every once in a while,</i>

79
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:56,008
<i>there's a day
when I don't have to be a princess.</i>

80
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,096
<i>No lessons, no expectations.</i>

81
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,515
<i>A day where anything can happen.</i>

82
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,095
<i>A day I can change my fate.</i>

83
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,395
Yah!

84
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:26,238
<i>When cold wind is a' calling,
and the sky is clear and bright</i>

85
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:31,999
<i>Misty mountains sing and beckon,
lead me out into the light</i>

86
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,293
<i>I Will ride, I Will fly</i>

87
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,342
<i>Chase the wind and touch the sky</i>

88
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:44,094
<i>I will fly
Chase the wind and touch the sky</i>

89
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,221
Whoo-hoo!

90
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:05,569
<i>Where dark woods hide secrets
and mountains are fierce and bold</i>

91
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:11,625
<i>Deep waters hold reflections
of times lost long ago</i>

92
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,671
<i>I will read every story,
take hold of my own dream</i>

93
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,713
Oh!

94
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,884
<i>Be as strong as the seas are stormy</i>

95
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,712
<i>And proud as an eagle's scream</i>

96
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,765
<i>I Will ride, I Will fly</i>

97
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,764
<i>Chase the wind and touch the sky</i>

98
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:35,600
<i>I will fly
Chase the wind and touch the sky</i>

99
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,119
<i>And touch the sky</i>

100
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,196
Whoo!

101
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,496
<i>Chase the wind</i>

102
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:01,755
<i>Touch the sky</i>

103
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,516
I'm starving. You hungry too, Angus?

104
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,971
Pfft!

105
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,023
Oats it is, then.

106
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,898
Good day, Princess.

107
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,854
I cannot find the salt.
Where did you put it?

108
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,190
It was over there a minute ago,
the last time I looked at it.

109
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,912
And then, out of nowhere,
the biggest bear you've ever seen!

110
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,116
His hide littered with the weapons
of fallen warriors.

111
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,829
His face scarred with one dead eye.

112
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,247
I drew my sword and...

113
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,877
Whoosh!

114
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,084
One swipe, his sword shattered.

115
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,296
Then "chomp"! Dad's leg was clean off.

116
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,048
Down the monster's throat it went.

117
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,055
Oh, that's my favorite part.

118
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,388
Mor'du has never been seen since,

119
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:01,940
and is roaming the wilds
waiting his chance of revenge.

120
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,521
Let him return.

121
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,652
I'll finish what I guddled in the first place.

122
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,531
Merida, a princess does not place
her weapons on the table.

123
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,784
Mum! It's just my bow.

124
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,833
A princess should not have weapons
in my opinion.

125
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,251
Leave her be.

126
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,209
Princess or not,
learning to fight is essential.

127
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,086
Mum?
You'll never guess what I did today.

128
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,338
- Hm?
- I climbed the Crone's Tooth,

129
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,881
and drank from the Fire Falls.

130
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,796
Fire Falls?

131
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,634
They say only the ancient kings
were brave enough to drink the fire.

132
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,600
- What did you do, dear?
- Nothing, Mum.

133
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,147
Hungry, aren't we?

134
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,600
- Mum!
- You'll get dreadful collywobbles.

135
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,653
Oh, Fergus, will you look at
your daughter's plate?

136
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,695
So what?

137
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,274
- Oh, you great...
- Don't let them lick...

138
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,654
Boys, you're naughty.

139
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,827
Don't just play with your haggis.

140
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,822
- Urgh!
- Och, how do you know you don't like it,

141
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,999
if you won't try it?

142
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,917
That's just a wee sheep's stomach.

143
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,621
It's delicious. Mm!

144
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,002
- My lady.
- Thank you, Maudie.

145
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,253
You're getting too big,
the two of you.

146
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,259
Aha.

147
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,682
From the Lords Macintosh,
MacGuffin and Dingwall.

148
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,134
Their responses, no doubt.

149
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,719
AYE, aye!

150
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,804
Hey, hey!

151
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,354
Stay out of my food,
you greedy mongrels.

152
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,145
Chew on that, you manky dogs!

153
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,275
Fergus?

154
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,032
They've all accepted.

155
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,996
Who's accepted what, Mother?

156
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,290
Boys, you are excused.

157
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,244
Oof!

158
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,209
Hey!

159
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,008
What did I do now?

160
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,302
Your father has something
to discuss with you.

161
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,968
Fergus?

162
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,675
Oh.

163
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,897
Er... Merida.

164
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:11,065
The lords are presenting
their sons as suitors for your betrothal.

165
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,991
- What?
- The clans have accepted.

166
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,120
- Dad!
- What? I...

167
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,368
You... She... Elinor?

168
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,041
Honestly, Merida, I don't know why
you're reacting this way.

169
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,130
This year, each clan will present a suitor
to compete in the games for your hand.

170
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,924
I suppose a princess
just does what she's told?

171
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,422
A princess does not raise her voice.

172
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,302
Merida, this is what you've been
preparing for your whole life.

173
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,264
No, it's what you've been preparing
me for my whole life.

174
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,687
I won't go through with it.
You can't make me.

175
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,890
Merida!

176
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,941
Huh? Merida!

177
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,687
Urgh!

178
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,023
Boys!

179
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,914
Mother. Suitors? Marriage?

180
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,333
Once there was an ancient kingdom...

181
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,036
Oh, Mum!

182
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,746
Ancient kingdom.

183
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,877
Its name long forgotten,

184
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,461
ruled by a wise and fair king
who was much beloved.

185
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:19,967
And when he grew old he divided
the kingdom among his four sons,

186
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:24,429
that they should be the pillars
on which the peace of the land rested.

187
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,811
But the oldest prince
wanted to rule the land for himself.

188
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,488
He followed his own path
and the kingdom fell

189
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,743
to war, and chaos and ruin.

190
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,741
That's a nice story.

191
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,073
It's not just a story, Merida.

192
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,205
Legends are lessons.
They ring with truths.

193
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,752
Och, Mum.

194
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,000
I would advise you
to make your peace with this.

195
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,922
The clans are coming
to present their suitors.

196
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,342
- It's not fair.
- Och, Merida.

197
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,170
It's marriage.
It's not the end of the world.

198
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,647
- You're muttering.
- I don't mutter.

199
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,565
Aye, you do. You mutter, lass,
when something's troubling you.

200
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,858
I blame you. Stubbornness.

201
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,564
It's entirely from your side of the family.

202
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,526
I take it the talk didn't go too well, then?

203
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,111
Och, I don't know what to do.

204
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,199
- Speak to her, dear.
- I do speak to her.

205
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,581
- She just doesn't listen.
- Come on, now.

206
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,204
Pretend I'm Merida. Speak to me.

207
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,210
What would you say?

208
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,792
Och... I can't do this.

209
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,468
Sure you can.

210
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,137
There, there. That's my queen.

211
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,181
Right, here we go.

212
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,974
"I don't want to get married.

213
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,519
"I want to stay single
and let my hair flow in the wind

214
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:50,519
"as I ride through the glen
firing arrows into the sunset."

215
00:14:55,937 --> 00:15:00,909
Merida, all this work,
all the time spent preparing you,

216
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,613
schooling you,
giving you everything we never had.

217
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,332
I ask you, what do you expect us to do?

218
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,503
Call off the gathering.
Would that kill them?

219
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,920
You're the queen.

220
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,295
You can just tell the lords
the princess is not ready for this.

221
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:20,049
In fact, she might not ever be ready
for this, so that's that.

222
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:24,178
Good day to you. We'll expect your
declarations of war in the morning.

223
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,932
I understand this must all seem unfair.

224
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,308
Even I had reservations
when I faced betrothal.

225
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,892
But we can't just run away
from who we are.

226
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,444
I don't want my life to be over.

227
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,941
I want my freedom!

228
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,274
But are you willing to pay the price
your freedom will cost?

229
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,451
I'm not doing any of this to hurt you.

230
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:49,078
If you could just try to see what I do,
I do out of love.

231
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,127
But it's my life, it's...

232
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,287
I'm just not ready.

233
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,247
I think you'd see, if you could just...

234
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,379
I think I could make you understand
if you would just...

235
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,052
- ...listen.
- ...listen.

236
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,554
I swear, Angus,
this isn't going to happen.

237
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,178
Not if I have any say in it.

238
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,496
MacGuffin!

239
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,073
MacGuffin!

240
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,994
- Dingwall!
- Dingwall!

241
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,628
- Macintosh!
- Macintosh!

242
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,423
Ooh! Aah!

243
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,008
Oh.

244
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:56,107
You look absolutely beautiful.

245
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,479
I can't breathe.

246
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,560
Och, shush! Give us a turn.

247
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,318
I can't move.

248
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,445
It's too tight.

249
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,278
It's perfect.

250
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,214
- Merida?
- Mum?

251
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,130
Just...

252
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,011
Remember to smile.

253
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,489
Aye, they're coming.

254
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,866
Places, everyone. Places.

255
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,949
Oh!

256
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,347
I look fine, woman! Leave me be!

257
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,016
My Lord!

258
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,311
I want to announce the arrival
of the lords...

259
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,434
- Ow!
- Who goes there? Who goes there?

260
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,157
Boy!

261
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,258
So, here we are... Er...

262
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,219
- ...the four clans.
- Aye.

263
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,300
- Er... Gathering...
- Oh.

264
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,220
...for...

265
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,853
- ...the presentation of the suitors.
- ...the presentation of the suitors.

266
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,647
Clan Macintosh.

267
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,070
Macintosh!

268
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,649
Your Majesty,
I present my heir and scion,

269
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:13,236
who defended our land
from the northern invaders,

270
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,495
and with his own sword, Stab Blooder,

271
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,701
vanquished 1,000 foes.

272
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,786
Macintosh!

273
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,005
Clan MacGuffin!

274
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,754
MacGuffin!

275
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,762
Good Majesty, I present my eldest son,

276
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,636
who scuttled the Viking longships

277
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,437
and with his bare hands
vanquished 2,000 foes.

278
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,681
MacGuffin!

279
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,685
Clan Dingwall.

280
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,770
Dingwall!

281
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,949
I present my only son

282
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:57,538
who was besieged by 10,000 Romans

283
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,868
and he took out a whole armada
singlehandedly.

284
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,460
With one arm, he was...

285
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,419
With one arm he was steering the ship

286
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,627
and with the other
he held his mighty sword

287
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,429
and struck down a whole attacking fleet.

288
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,882
- Lies!
- What? I heard that.

289
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,134
Go on. Say it to my face.

290
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,141
Or are ye scared, simpering jackanapes,

291
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,518
afraid to muss your pretty hair?

292
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,726
- At least we have hair.
- And all our teeth.

293
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,230
Huh?

294
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,783
And we don't hide under bridges,
you grumpy old troll.

295
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,448
You want to laugh, huh?

296
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,663
Wee Dingwall!

297
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,954
Get off me!

298
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,184
Nut 'em! Nut 'em! That's the way to...

299
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,558
All right.

300
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,895
Shut it!

301
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:13,948
Now, that's all done.
You've had your go at each other.

302
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,863
Show a little decorum.

303
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,949
And no more fighting.

304
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,543
Cw!

305
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,271
You want a fresh one?

306
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,449
Crivens, you're fierce.

307
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,872
I didn't start it. It Was...

308
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,621
My lady Queen, I feel terrible.
My humblest apologies.

309
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,294
- We mean no disrespect.
- I'm sorry, love, I didn't... But...

310
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,498
Yes, dear.

311
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,332
Now, where were we?

312
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,045
Ah, yes. In accordance with our laws,

313
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,638
by the rights of our heritage,

314
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,967
only the firstborn of each
of the great leaders

315
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,894
- may be presented as champion.
- Firstborn?

316
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,692
And thus compete for the hand
of the Princess of Dun Broch.

317
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,567
To win the fair maiden
they must prove their worth

318
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:38,821
by feats of strength or arms
in the games.

319
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:43,530
It is customary that the challenge
be determined by the princess herself.

320
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,330
Archery! Archery.

321
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:51,583
I choose archery.

322
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,503
Let the games begin!

323
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,404
Pull!

324
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,865
Pull!

325
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,334
- I'll just take one.
- Ooh!

326
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,587
Ooh!

327
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,723
Oh!

328
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,348
Now, I have told you,
you're not allowed... Oh!

329
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,850
- Oh!
- Argh!

330
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,057
Oh!

331
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,200
It's time!

332
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,123
- Archers, to your marks!
- Aye, archers, to your marks.

333
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,047
And may the lucky arrow find its target.

334
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,104
Oi! Get on with it.

335
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,358
Ooh.

336
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:45,697
- Och!
- I bet he wishes he was tossing cabers.

337
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,746
- Or holding up bridges.
- Shh!

338
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,831
Aw...

339
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,540
At least you hit the target, son.

340
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,964
Oh, that's attractive.

341
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,849
- I got it!
- Good arm.

342
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,019
And such lovely flowing locks.

343
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,721
- Fergus.
- What?

344
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,607
Oh, wee lamb.

345
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,786
Oh, come on! Shoot, boy!

346
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,919
Well done, lad! Well done.

347
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,630
Feast your eyes!

348
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,213
That's my boy.

349
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,933
Well, that's just grand now, isn't it?

350
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,761
- Guess who's coming to dinner?
- Fergus.

351
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,939
By the way, hope you don't mind
being called Lady Ding...

352
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,774
I am Merida.

353
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,077
Firstborn descendant of
Clan Dun Broch.

354
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:13,656
And I'll be shooting for my own hand.

355
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,865
Oh!

356
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,202
What are you doing?

357
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,922
Merida!

358
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,875
Curse this dress!

359
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,721
Merida, stop this!

360
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,857
Don't you dare loose another arrow.

361
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,282
Merida, I forbid it.

362
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,686
Michty me!
I've just about had enough of you, lass!

363
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,488
- You're the one that wants me to...
- You embarrassed them.

364
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,407
- You embarrassed me.
- I followed the rules.

365
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,359
You don't know what you've done!

366
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,036
- Just don't care howl...
- It'll be fire and sword if it's not set right.

367
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,661
- Just listen!
- I am the Queen!

368
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,286
You listen to me!

369
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,664
Ugh! This is so unfair!

370
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,461
Ha! Unfair?

371
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,585
You're never there for me.

372
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,338
This whole marriage is what you want.

373
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,591
Do you ever bother
to ask what I want? No.

374
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,514
You walk around telling me what to do,
what not to do,

375
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,093
trying to make me be like you.

376
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,474
Well, I'm not going to be like you.

377
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,226
Oh, you're acting like a child.

378
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,149
And you're a beast.

379
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,147
- That's what you are!
- Oh, Merida.

380
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,570
- I'll never be like you.
- No, stop that!

381
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,649
I'd rather die than be like you!

382
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,747
Merida, you are a princess,

383
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,621
- and I expect you to act like one.
- Mum!

384
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,332
Oh!

385
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,044
Merida!

386
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,547
Merida!

387
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,387
Oh, dear.

388
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,309
Ah!

389
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,772
Oh, no. What have I done?

390
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,729
Oh.

391
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,424
Oh! Oh! Oh!

392
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,767
Whoa!

393
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,219
Angus!

394
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,561
Come on, Angus.

395
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,815
Angus!

396
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,204
Why would the wisps lead me here?

397
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,757
Uh...

398
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,314
Oh, look around.

399
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,563
You holler if you see anything you like.

400
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,986
Everything is half off.

401
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,525
Uh...

402
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,407
- Who are you?
- Just a humble woodcarver.

403
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,988
Um...

404
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,782
I don't understand...

405
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,993
- See anything you like?
- Uh...

406
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:55,380
Perhaps a touch of whimsy
to brighten any dank chamber?

407
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,878
But the will-0'- the-wisps, they...

408
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,960
Oh! This is one of a kind!

409
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,008
I'll make you a deal for this rare prize.

410
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,761
- Your broom!
- Oh!

411
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,054
- It was sweeping by itself.
- That's ridiculous.

412
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,848
Wood cannot be imbued
with magical properties.

413
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,435
I should know. I'm a wit... Whittler.

414
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,270
Of wood.

415
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:23,610
Oh, how about this conversation starter?
It's made of yew wood.

416
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,036
Tough as stone.

417
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,488
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah!

418
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,619
That's stuffed.

419
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,952
- Staring is rude.
- Ooh! The crow's talking!

420
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,286
That's not all I can do.

421
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,622
La-la la-la la-la

422
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,968
- You're a witch!
- Woodcarver.

423
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,391
That's why the wisps led me here.

424
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,932
- Woodcarver!
- You'll change my fate!

425
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,810
- Woodcarver!
- You see, it's my mother.

426
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,984
I'm not a witch!
Too many unsatisfied customers.

427
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:04,366
If you're not going to buy anything,
get out.

428
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,577
- No! The wisps led me here!
- I don't care!

429
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:13,334
- Get out! Shoo! Get! Be gone with you!
- I'll buy it all.

430
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,628
- What? What was that?
- Every carving.

431
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,376
Well...

432
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:22,756
And how are you going
to pay for that, sweetie?

433
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,508
- With this.
- W...

434
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,013
Oh, my, that's lovely, that is.

435
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,435
That would set us up for months.

436
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:35,848
Ah, ah, ah.

437
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:41,779
Every carving and one spell.

438
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,491
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

439
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,115
I want a spell to change my mum.

440
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,659
That'll change my fate.

441
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,035
Hmm... Done!

442
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,917
Where are you going?

443
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,711
There.

444
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,130
What are you doing?

445
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,133
You never conjure where you carve.

446
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,793
Very important.

447
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,925
The last time I did this
was for a prince.

448
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,887
Easy on the eyes. Tight pants.

449
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,600
He demanded I give him
the strength of ten men.

450
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,936
And he gave me this for a spell.

451
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,695
A spell that would change his fate.

452
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,028
And did he get what he was after?

453
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,735
Yes.

454
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:33,914
And made off with an especially
attractive mahogany cheese board.

455
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,742
Now, what do I need? Oh!

456
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,873
Just a little bit of this.

457
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:39,953
Ah.

458
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,037
Hoo!

459
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,010
Tee-tee-tee-tee. Whoosh.

460
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,837
<i>That'll do.</i>

461
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,855
Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi.

462
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:12,696
And now let's see. What have we here?

463
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,537
Oh!

464
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,667
Hey!

465
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,545
Uh, a cake?

466
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,625
- You don't want it?
- Yes! I want it.

467
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:30,262
You're sure if I give this to my mum,

468
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,263
it will change my fate?

469
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,094
Oh.

470
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,474
Trust me. It'll do the trick, dearie.

471
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,983
Expect delivery of your purchase
within a fortnight.

472
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,060
Ooh! Ooh...

473
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,154
What was that thing about the spell?

474
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,821
Did you say something about

475
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,904
the spell?

476
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:02,912
<i>Mor'du, Mor'du, now the time has
come for all of us to slaughter you</i>

477
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,663
Hooray!

478
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,168
<i>Mor'du, Mor'du...</i>

479
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,935
- Merida.
- Mum!

480
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,861
Ooh, uh... I, uh...

481
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,032
- Oh, I've been worried sick.
- You... You were?

482
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,657
I didn't know where you'd gone
or when you'd come back.

483
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,614
I didn't know what to think.
Oh, look at your dress.

484
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,576
Oh. Angus threw me. But I'm not hurt.

485
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:45,788
Well, you're home now,
so that's the end of it.

486
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:50,133
- Honestly?
- I've pacified the lords for now.

487
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,178
Your father's out there
"entertaining" them.

488
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,051
<i>Come taste my blade, you manky bear</i>

489
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,803
<i>For gobbling up my /99</i>

490
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,936
<i>I'll hunt you, then I'll skin you,
hang your noggin on a peg...</i>

491
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:07,150
Of course, we both know
a decision still has to be made.

492
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,903
- What's this?
- It's a peace offering.

493
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:17,156
I made it. For you. Special.

494
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,114
You made this for me?

495
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:22,870
Mm.

496
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,584
Oh. Interesting flavor.

497
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,633
- How do you feel?
- What... What is that?

498
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,335
- Different?
- Mm...

499
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,885
Tart and, um, gamy.

500
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,684
Have you changed your mind at all
about the marriage and all that?

501
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,178
Oh, that's better.

502
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,764
Now, why don't we go
upstairs to the lords

503
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,771
and put this whole kerfuffle to rest?

504
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,193
Hm?

505
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:57,905
Ooh.

506
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,783
- Mother?
- I'm woozy suddenly.

507
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,285
My head's spinning like a top. Ooh!

508
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:07,119
- Mum!
- Oh, suddenly I'm not so well.

509
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:11,048
Er... How... How do you feel
about the marriage now?

510
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,126
Merida! Oh, just take me to my room.

511
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,803
All right, that's fine.
That's just fine.

512
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:20,724
A little to the left. That's good.
A wee bit to the left. That's good.

513
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,267
It's good enough.

514
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,891
Now, clear out of there, boys.
I don't want you to spoil my shot.

515
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,138
- What?
- My lady Queen.

516
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,146
We've been waiting patiently.

517
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:35,231
Milords, I am out of sorts
at the moment.

518
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,113
But you shall have your answer.

519
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,660
- Oh!
- Eh?

520
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,703
Presently.

521
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,749
Now, if you'll excuse us.

522
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,001
Elinor, look!

523
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,079
It's Mor'du!

524
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,624
Elinor? Are you all right, dear?

525
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,550
Fine. I'm fine.

526
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,879
Go about avenging your leg. Oh...

527
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,010
Aye. You heard her, lads.

528
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:05,185
I dream about the perfect way
to make this devil die.

529
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:12,609
Just take all the time you need
to getting yourself right, Mum.

530
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,655
Then maybe in a bit you might have
something new to say on the marriage.

531
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,152
What was in that cake?

532
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,825
Cake.

533
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,199
Mum?

534
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,953
So I'll just tell them
the wedding's off, then?

535
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,038
Mum?

536
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,157
Bear!

537
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:26,966
Oh!

538
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,981
Mum?

539
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,983
You're... You're a bear!

540
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,486
Why a bear?

541
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:50,741
Oh, that scaffy witch
gave me a gammy spell.

542
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,127
It's not my fault.

543
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,170
I didn't ask her
to change you into a bear.

544
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:00,876
I just wanted her to change you.

545
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,392
Shh. Did you hear that?

546
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,720
Something's not right.

547
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:18,356
There's no point in having a go at me.
The witch is to blame.

548
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,812
Goggly old hag.

549
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,990
Eyes all over the place.

550
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,072
Unbelievable.

551
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,830
<i>I'll get her to fix this.</i>

552
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,533
Why do I always get blamed
for everything? It's just not fair.

553
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,248
Everybody, follow me.

554
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,332
And keep a sharp eye.

555
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,678
Here we go.
Another hunt through the castle.

556
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,426
But we haven't had dessert yet.

557
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,762
I have no idea.

558
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,391
Mum, you can't go out there.

559
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,812
Mum! Wait!

560
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:07,318
What are you doing?
Dad. The Bear King?

561
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,573
If he so much as sees you, you're dead.

562
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:13,414
Another one of
your entertainments to bore us to death!

563
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,036
Oh, and what exactly are we after...

564
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,117
Mum!

565
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,043
LORD MACINTOSH:... my liege?

566
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,293
Best to humor him.
He is, after all, the King.

567
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,587
He's like a hound with that nose of his.

568
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,890
Mum, wait.

569
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,387
We have to...

570
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,845
Follow me.

571
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,554
Stop.

572
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,851
Stop!

573
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,357
You're covered with fur.

574
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,109
You're not naked.

575
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,156
It's not like anyone's gonna see you.

576
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,036
Now you've done it.

577
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,249
Maudie!

578
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,047
Just calm down, lass. What is it?

579
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,250
Spit it out, Maudie!

580
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,176
A bear!

581
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,878
I knew it!

582
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,969
Would you just listen to me?

583
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,927
We can't go this way. You'll be seen.

584
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,306
Quick! This way!

585
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,680
Mum?

586
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,623
Mum? Oh!

587
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,290
Oh!

588
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,345
Hm?

589
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,599
A witch turned Mum into a bear.
It's not my fault.

590
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,057
We've got to get out of the castle.
I need your help.

591
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,316
Oh, all right.

592
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:07,692
You can have my desserts
for two... Three weeks.

593
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,525
Okay. Fine. A year.

594
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,324
- Did you hear that?
- Shh.

595
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,376
There it goes!

596
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,507
Come on, lads!

597
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,520
There it goes!

598
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,407
Come on, Mum.

599
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,367
Think we should lay a trap?

600
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,168
Try shutting yours!

601
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,548
There he is!

602
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,642
I'm sure it went this way.

603
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,268
You can see my house from here.

604
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,271
It must have sprouted wings.

605
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,524
Was carried away by a giant birdy.

606
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,573
- A dragon, perhaps.
- Bear in the castle!

607
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,026
Doesn't make sense.
It cannot open doors.

608
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,985
He's got big giant paws!

609
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,446
Let's just get inside.

610
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:44,333
It's locked.
- Dingwall was the last up.

611
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,581
I propped it open with a stick.

612
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:56,338
What did you see, Maudie?
Just spit it out, Maudie.

613
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,923
Oh, for goodness' sakes, Maudie,
would you get a grip?

614
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,188
Maudie, honey, come here!
It's all right!

615
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,187
Come on, Mum. Quick.

616
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,607
Shh.

617
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,294
They'll be fine. Won't you, boys?

618
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,135
Mum, we've got to hurry.

619
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,632
Now, I'll be back soon.

620
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:41,012
Go on and help yourself
to anything you want, as a reward.

621
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,607
Oh!

622
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,534
Right!

623
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,706
Where are these wisps?

624
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:13,130
Come out, wisps. Come on out.

625
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,343
Lead me to the witch's cottage.

626
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,463
I'm here!

627
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,975
Fine. Don't come out
now that my mum's watching.

628
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:31,183
I was standing right here
and the wisp appeared right there.

629
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,690
Then a whole trail of them
led me off into the forest.

630
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:45,121
Oh, does she think we're just going
to happen upon the witch's cottage?

631
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,345
Oh, Mum, I know this place.

632
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,847
The witch's cottage...

633
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,806
It's this way! Come on! Hurry!

634
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:20,156
I can't believe it. I found it.

635
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,446
No. She was here.

636
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:31,580
No, really, she was just here.

637
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,628
Oh, Wait.

638
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,339
No.

639
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:44,844
No, no. No! No!

640
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,185
Oh.

641
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,624
<i>Welcome to the Crafty Carver,</i>

643
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:19,374

00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,897
<i>To speak with a live homunculus...</i>

649
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:39,436
<i>Princess, I'm off to the Wickerman
Festival in Stornoway</i>

650
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,486
<i>and won't be back till spring.</i>

651
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:45,192
<i>There's one bit I forgot to tell you
about the spell.</i>

652
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:49,154
<i>By the second sunrise,
your spell will be permanent,</i>

653
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:53,582
<i>unless you remember these words.</i>

654
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,669
<i>Fate be changed,</i>

655
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,667
<i>look inside,</i>

656
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,669
<i>mend the bond</i>

657
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,796
<i>torn by pride.</i>

658
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:06,925
"Fate be changed... Mend the bond."
What does that mean?

659
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,677
<i>One more time.</i>

660
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,633
<i>Fate be changed,</i>

661
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,764
<i>look inside,</i>

662
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,641
<i>mend the bond</i>

663
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,269
<i>torn by pride.</i>

664
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,691
<i>That's it. Ta-ta.</i>

665
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:22,646
<i>Oh, and thank you for shopping
at the Crafty Carver.</i>

666
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,356
No. No! Where'd you go?

667
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,942
<i>- Welcome to the Crafty Can/er...
- What?</i>

668
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,244
...for all your...

669
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,620
Maybe there's a book of spells.
Look around. We'll need more vials.

670
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,541
<i>I'm off to the Wickerman Festival
in Stornoway...</i>

671
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:45,547
<i>Thank you for visiting.
Have a lovely day.</i>

672
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:24,791
We'll sort it out tomorrow.

673
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,425
Oh.

674
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,475
My brave wee lassie, I'm here.

675
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,554
I'll always be right here.

676
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,957
Uh... Good morning.

677
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,128
So...

678
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,589
What's all this supposed to be?

679
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,421
Oh.

680
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,429
What?

681
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,104
Sorry. I don't speak bear.

682
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,690
Oh.

683
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:18,533
Ah!

684
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,795
- Find those by the creek, did you?
- Mm-hm.

685
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,250
They're nightshade berries.

686
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,085
Mmm.

687
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,421
They're poisonous.

688
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:47,020
Where did you get this water?
It has worms.

689
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,784
Come on.

690
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,001
Breakfast.

691
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:16,759
Oh, wait. A princess should not
have weapons, in your opinion.

692
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,597
Uh-huh...

693
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,094
There you go.

694
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,014
Go on.

695
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:28,474
How do you know you don't like it
if you won't try it?

696
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,449
Mm.

697
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:04,640
<i>This love it is a distant star</i>

698
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,848
<i>Guiding us home wherever we are</i>

699
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,937
<i>This love it is a burning sun</i>

700
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:18,487
<i>Shining light on the things
that we've done</i>

701
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:25,247
<i>I tried to speak to you every day</i>

702
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:32,251
<i>But each word we spoke
the wind blew away</i>

703
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,591
<i>How did we let it come to this?</i>

704
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,756
<i>What we just tasted...</i>

705
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:52,684
<i>How will it feel when this day is done?</i>

706
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:59,991
<i>And can we keep
what we've only begun?</i>

707
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:07,453
<i>Could these walls
come crumbling down?</i>

708
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:14,622
<i>I want to feel my feet on the ground</i>

709
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:20,382
<i>Can we carry this love that we share</i>

710
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:26,225
<i>Into the open air</i>

711
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:34,142
<i>Into the open air</i>

712
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,602
Hey!

713
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,649
Where are you going?

714
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:52,410
<i>This love it is a burning sun</i>

715
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,957
Mum, come back.

716
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,844
Uh...

717
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,967
Oh...

718
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,053
Mum, is that you?

719
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,940
Uh... Mum?

720
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,691
You changed.

721
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,197
Like you were a...

722
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,580
I mean, like you were a bear
on the inside.

723
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,959
A wisp.

724
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,670
Mum!

725
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:46,755
Stop it!

726
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,387
Mum, no!

727
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,720
Mum...

728
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,186
Jings, crivens, help ma boab.

729
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,772
Mum, I know you're scared,

730
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,825
you're tired, you don't understand,

731
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,154
but we've got to keep our heads.

732
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,660
Just calm down.

733
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,158
Listen.

734
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,113
They'll show us the way.

735
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,181
Mum, look.

736
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,822
Why did the wisps
bring us here?

737
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,348
Whoever they were,
they've been gone for a long, long time.

738
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,853
I'm fine, Mum.

739
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,313
Just fine.

740
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,990
It's, uh,

741
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:20,958
a throne room.

742
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,462
You suppose this could've
been the kingdom

743
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,256
in that story you were telling me?

744
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:29,175
The one with the princes.

745
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,556
One,

746
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,932
two,

747
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,475
three,

748
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,394
four.

749
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,346
The oldest.

750
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,480
Split, like the tapestry.

751
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:55,452
The spell. It's happened before.

752
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,534
"Strength of ten men."

753
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:06,088
"Fate be changed."

754
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:11,127
"Changed his fate."

755
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,837
Oh, no.

756
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,968
The prince became...

757
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,847
Mor'du.

758
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:32,006
Mum, we need to get back to the castle.

759
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:35,924
If we don't hurry,
you'll become like Mor'du.

760
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,379
A bear!

761
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,635
A real bear. Forever!

762
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:43,476
"Mend the bond torn by pride."

763
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:47,891
The witch gave us the answer.
The tapestry.

764
01:02:56,648 --> 01:03:00,369
Mum, do you have a better idea?

765
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,005
<i>That'll do.</i>

766
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:37,360
No more talk. No more traditions.

767
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:38,816
We settle this now!

768
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,491
You're the King.

769
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:44,492
You decide which one of our sons
your daughter will marry.

770
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:47,666
None of your sons
are fit to marry my daughter.

771
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,745
Then our alliance is over!
This means war!

772
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,213
They're gonna murder each other.

773
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,761
You've got to stop them
before it's too late.

774
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,968
I know, I know!

775
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,722
But how do we get you through there
and up to the tapestry

776
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,848
with the lot of them
boiling over like that?

777
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,393
"Oh!

778
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:30,541
- What are you doing, lass?
- It's all right, Dad.

779
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:33,291
I, um...

780
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,381
I have... “.

781
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,922
Well, you see, I...

782
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,595
I have been in conference
with the Queen.

783
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:45,549
- Is that so?
- Aye, it is.

784
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,885
- Well, where is she, then?
- She, uh...

785
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,061
How do we know that
this isn't some trick?

786
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,979
- I'd never...
- This is highly irregular.

787
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,932
- What are you playing at?
- Where is the Queen?

788
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,609
We will not stand
for any more of this jiggery-pokery.

789
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,857
- That's right. Let's see her.
- Shut it!

790
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,823
Well, I, uh...

791
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:10,990
Uh...

792
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:19,083
Once there was an ancient kingdom.

793
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,959
What is this?

794
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:24,592
That kingdom fell into war

795
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,765
and chaos and ruin...

796
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,935
Och, we've all heard that tale.
Lost kingdom.

797
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,602
Aye, but it's true.

798
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:35,308
I know now how one selfish act
can turn the fate of a kingdom.

799
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,767
Bah, it's just a legend.

800
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,602
Legends are lessons.

801
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,488
They ring with truths.

802
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:44,115
Our kingdom is young.

803
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,451
Our stories are not yet legend.

804
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:49,655
But in them, our bond was struck.

805
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,865
Our clans were once enemies.

806
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,293
But when invaders threatened us
from the sea,

807
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,372
you joined together to defend our lands.

808
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,587
You fought for each other.

809
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,634
You risked everything for each other.

810
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,967
Lord MacGuffin, my dad saved your life,

811
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,595
stopping an arrow
as you ran to Dingwall's aid.

812
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,472
Aye, and I'll never forget it.

813
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,224
And, Lord Macintosh,

814
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,648
you saved my dad
when you charged in on heavy horse

815
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,441
and held off the advance.

816
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:22,566
And we all know how Lord Dingwall
broke the enemy line.

817
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,693
With a mighty throw of his spear!

818
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,649
I was aiming at you, you big tumshie.

819
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,871
The story of this kingdom
is a powerful one.

820
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,495
My dad rallied your forces

821
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,952
and you made him your king.

822
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:41,131
It was an alliance forged in bravery
and friendship

823
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,958
and it lives to this day.

824
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:51,015
But I've been selfish.

825
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,139
I tore a great rift in our kingdom.

826
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,063
There's no one to blame but me.

827
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:01,610
And I know now
that I need to amend my mistake

828
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,442
and mend our bond.

829
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,826
And so, there is the matter
of my betrothal.

830
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:14,536
I've decided to do what's right

831
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:15,786
and...

832
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,243
...and...

833
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,670
...and...

834
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:24,792
...break tradition.

835
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,015
My mother...

836
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,974
...the Queen, feels...

837
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:40,811
...uh, in her heart

838
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,813
that I...

839
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,193
...that we be free to...

840
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:52,160
...write our own story...

841
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:58,158
...follow our hearts

842
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:02,747
and find love in our own time.

843
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,594
That's beautiful.

844
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:13,048
The Queen and I put the decision
to you, my lords.

845
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:17,803
Might our young people decide
for themselves who they will love?

846
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:18,932
Huh?

847
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:22,141
Well, since you've obviously
made up your minds about this,

848
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,191
I have one thing to say.

849
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,770
- This is...
- A grand idea!

850
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:29,151
Give us our own say
in choosing our fate.

851
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:32,575
- What?
- Aye. Why shouldn't we choose?

852
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,740
But she's the princess.

853
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,789
I did not pick her out. It was your idea.

854
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:41,118
And you... You feel the same way?

855
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:48,670
Good?

856
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:52,883
Well, that settles it.

857
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:57,684
Let these lads try and win her heart
before they win her hand.

858
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,102
If they can.

859
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:02,147
I say, the wee Dingwall
has a fighting chance.

860
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,644
Fine, then. Seems for once we agree.

861
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:07,773
It was my idea in the first place.

862
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,656
Just like your mum.

863
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,036
You devil.

864
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,753
Uh... Everyone to the cellar!

865
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:34,258
Let's crack open the King's
private reserve to celebrate!

866
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,341
Oh.

867
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,801
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

868
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,057
Psst. Bring the tiny glasses.

869
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,452
Oh, the tapestry!

870
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,741
Mend the bond...

871
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,044
Mend the bond.

872
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,872
Stitch it up. This'll change you back.

873
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:11,299
We just need needle and thread.

874
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,849
Mum?

875
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,344
Mum? Not now.

876
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:26,102
No. Please, not now.

877
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,937
Mum...

878
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:30,268
shh.

879
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:43,365
Elinor, dear, you'll never guess
who just solved our little suitor problem.

880
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,594
Elinor!

881
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:03,138
It can't be true!
Elinor, answer me, lass!

882
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,345
Elinor!

883
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,773
Merida.

884
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:11,146
- What?
- Dad, no! It's not what you think.

885
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,273
- Merida, get back!
- No!

886
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:20,451
No, Dad! Don't hurt her!

887
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,283
Get out of here!

888
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,956
Merida! No!

889
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,455
No!

890
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,890
Mum.

891
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:50,724
It's all right. I'm all right. It's nothing.
It's just a little scratch. Mum!

892
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,775
My liege!

893
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,272
Fergus.

894
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,151
Bear!

895
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,278
Dad!

896
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,906
Count your stars, lass.
It almost had you. Are you hurt?

897
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,702
It's your wife, Elinor.

898
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,995
Close the gate!

899
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:14,505
- You're talking nonsense!
- It's the truth!

900
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,800
There was a witch and she
gave me a spell. It's not Mor'du.

901
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,298
Mor'du or not, I'll avenge your mother!

902
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:24,349
- I'll not risk losing you, too.
- No, Dad! Just listen to me.

903
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,051
Listen! You can't!

904
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:31,480
- It's your wife Elinor!
- Maudie, keep this and don't let her out.

905
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,020
- What about the bear?
- Just stay put.

906
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:38,939
Oh...

907
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,968
Come on, you sorry bunch of galoots!
Yah!

908
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:14,224
Mum!

909
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,900
No.

910
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,522
No. Mum.

911
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,087
Maudie. Maudie!

912
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,795
I need you!

913
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,346
Now!

914
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,969
Oh, no.

915
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,268
Maudie.

916
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,024
Get the key.

917
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:17,749
Yah!

918
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,584
Oh, Maudie!

919
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,388
Needle and thread. Needle and thread.
Needle and thread.

920
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,237
There he goes!

921
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,994
Needle and thread.
Needle and thread. Needle and thread.

922
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,325
Ah. You beauty!

923
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,363
One, two... Huh?

924
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,073
{THUD)
- MAUDE: Om

925
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,723
Steady, Hamish.

926
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:58,804
There he goes.

927
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,941
We've got his track!

928
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,869
- Back, back, back!
- Get him!

929
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:23,788
Angus! Easy, laddie.

930
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:29,168
Hubert, Harris, help Hamish.

931
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,013
Watch your blade!
You're going to take somebody's arm off!

932
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,182
Aye, we've got you now!

933
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,387
- Give me a hand over here!
- Put your back into it, Dingwalll

934
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:40,804
I'm doing all the pulling here.

935
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,185
Down you go, you scoundrel.

936
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:47,110
Done!

937
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:55,035
Yah!

938
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,210
Hah!

939
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:16,011
- Get back. That's my mother.
- Are you out of your mind, lass?

940
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,263
Mum, are you hurt?

941
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:25,854
Merida!

942
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:31,277
I'll not let you kill my mother.

943
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:33,904
Boys!

944
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:36,826
Boys?

945
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,123
- Mor'du!
- Kill it!

946
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,917
You scoundrel!

947
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:58,349
Come on!
I'll take you with my bare hands!

948
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,463
Mum!

949
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:52,246
The second sunrise.

950
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,420
No...

951
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,166
I don't understand. I...

952
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:52,147
Oh, Mum, I'm sorry.

953
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,352
This is all my fault.

954
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,437
I did this to you.

955
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:00,439
To us.

956
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,739
You've always been there for me.

957
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,117
You've never given up on me.

958
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,876
I just want you back.

959
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,545
I want you back, Mummy.

960
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,317
I love you.

961
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,147
Mum! You're back!

962
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,280
You changed!

963
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,948
Oh, darling,

964
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,034
we both have.

965
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,491
Elinor!

966
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:32,872
Oh, Oh, Oh!

967
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:37,958
Elinor! Oh!

968
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:40,210
Ah!

969
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:43,300
Er... Urgh!

970
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:45,252
Oh, dear.

971
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:48,676
You're back. She came back to us.

972
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:50,632
It's a great day for this kingdom.
The curse is broke.

973
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,385
Oh! Mum.

974
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,309
Ooh. Erm... Dear?

975
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,061
- Eh?
- I'm naked.

976
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,393
Naked as a wee babby.

977
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,570
Don't just stare at me. Do something!

978
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:06,485
What the... Avert your eyes, lads!

979
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:07,987
Show some respect!

980
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,328
Now that's what I call
a wee naked babby!

981
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:22,172
Merida, Elinor, hurry up.
They're leaving.

982
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,420
- Mum!
- They're off! Come on!

983
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,628
We've got to wave them off!
Come along!

984
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:34,556
<i>Though I may speak
some tongue of old</i>

985
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:39,019
<i>Or even spit out some holy word</i>

986
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:46,321
<i>I have no strength with which to speak</i>

987
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,027
Oof!

988
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:51,406
<i>When you sit me down
and see I'm weak</i>

989
01:23:55,614 --> 01:24:00,745
Goodbye! All the best!
Fair wind to your sails!

990
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:04,127
<i>We will run and scream</i>

991
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,125
<i>You will dance with me</i>

992
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,835
But how did this...

993
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:17,470
<i>There are those who say fate
is something beyond our command,</i>

994
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,852
<i>that destiny is not our own.</i>

995
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:23,350
<i>But I know better.</i>

996
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,563
<i>Our fate lives within us.</i>

997
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,072
<i>You only have to be brave enough
to see it.</i>

998
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:43,037
<i>We will run and scream</i>

999
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,294
<i>You will dance with me</i>

1000
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:51,629
<i>We'll fulfill our dreams
and we'll be free</i>

1001
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:57,055
<i>We will be who we are</i>

1002
01:24:57,134 --> 01:25:00,559
<i>And then heal our scars</i>

1003
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:05,484
<i>Sadness will be far away</i>

1004
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:24,877
<i>So I had done wrong</i>

1005
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:28,582
<i>But you put me right</i>

1006
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:33,721
<i>My judgment burned
in the black of night</i>

1007
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:40,721
<i>When I give less than I take</i>

1008
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:46,104
<i>It is my fault, my own mistake</i>

1009
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:51,488
<i>We will run and scream</i>

1010
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,908
<i>You will dance with me</i>

1011
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:59,955
<i>We'll fulfill our dreams
and we'll be free</i>

1012
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:05,536
<i>We will be who we are</i>

1013
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:09,089
<i>And then heal our scars</i>

1014
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:14,762
<i>Sadness will be far away</i>

1015
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:02,285
Delivery. Sign here, sign here.

1016
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,833
Come on, birdbrain. I haven't got all day.

1016
01:33:08,305 --> 01:33:14,544
